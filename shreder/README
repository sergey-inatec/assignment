The shreder.go is the actaul implementation of the shred function and and shred_test.go are the tests. 

Due to some time constrainst I have not completed all the test cases however here are some scenarios that I would like to check: 

1. Attempt to delete the file which wsa created by some other user in shared folder 
2. Attempt to modify and then shred the file which was created by root user 
3. Attempt to delete system file when running under the root user 
4. Attempt to delete system file when running under reguliar user

This script can be used to delete files with sensitive data, although overriding it three times in case of large files can be quite resource intensive.
