This script automates the process of setting up a virtual machine using QEMU with
Ubuntu installed. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:
Download Ubuntu ISO: Downloads the Ubuntu ISO image file from the specified URL
(UBUNTU_ISO_URL) and saves it as ubuntu.iso.
Create Disk Image: Creates a disk image (ubuntu_disk.qcow2) with a size of 4GB using
QEMU's qemu-img command.
Install Ubuntu: Launches QEMU with the created disk image and the downloaded
Ubuntu ISO as a CD-ROM. This effectively starts the Ubuntu installation process within
the virtual machine.
Wait for Installation: Pauses the script and waits for the user to confirm that the Ubuntu
installation process has completed. This ensures that the virtual machine has been fully
installed before proceeding.
Boot Disk Image: Boots the virtual machine using QEMU with the installed disk image
(ubuntu_disk.qcow2).
Wait for Boot: Pauses the script for 30 seconds to allow time for the virtual machine to
boot up.
Mount Disk Image: Creates a mount point (/mnt/ubuntu_mount) and mounts disk image
(ubuntu_disk.qcow2) to it.
Add "Hello World" File: Creates a file named hello_world.txt inside the mounted disk
image directory (/mnt/ubuntu_mount) and writes "hello world" to it.
Unmount Disk Image: Unmounts the disk image from the mount point.
Clean Up: Removes the temporary files (ubuntu.iso) and directories created during the
process
